This repository showcases a weather classification project aimed at enhancing transportation safety through Computer Vision.
Leveraging a curated dataset of approximately 1500 images from Flickr, Unsplash, and Pexels, categorized into Cloudy, Foggy, Rainy, Shine, and Sunrise, 
we apply transfer learning on the VGG16 model to accurately classify diverse weather conditions.
